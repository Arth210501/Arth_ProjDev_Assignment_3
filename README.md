1. The Reader "about the project"

-- The user opens the registration form in their internet browser. 
-- The user will enter their name into the text box provided.
-- The user will enter their email address into the text box provided.
-- The user will enter their password into the password text box provided.
-- The user will click the submit button.
-- If the user has filled out all the required fields, a message will appear saying "Hello [name], Your email is [email], Your password is [password]".
-- If any of the required fields are left blank, an error message will appear.




2. The Reader about “navigating your repo”

-- Navigating your repository is essential to the success of the project. It is important to familiarise yourself with the folder structure and layout of the repository. This includes understanding how each component of the project is organised and where different files and folders are located. It is also important to understand how to create and manage branches and commits to ensure that code is versioned correctly and that changes are tracked properly.

-- The file Assignment3HandIn.html includes "github project link" where you have to add your git repo link to allow others to view your code and others repo files.




3.The Developer How to: 

(a) --Guidelines for the project:
-Ensure that all HTML elements and attributes used are valid and up to date
-Validate all form input to ensure it meets the criteria for the form
-Ensure that all JavaScript functions used are valid and up to date
-Ensure that all data is sanitized and validated before being submitted
-Ensure that all error messages are clear and informative
-Ensure that all user input is handled securely and safely


(b) --Test the component and project
--To test the component and project, unit testing, integration testing, and system testing should be conducted. Unit testing is used to verify that individual components of the system are working as intended. Integration testing is used to verify that components are working together as intended. System testing is used to verify that the entire system is working as intended.

Issue handling involves identifying and resolving any issues that arise during the development and testing process. This includes tracking and resolving bugs, tracking and resolving customer feedback, and tracking and resolving any other issues that arise.


(c) --Build the project and "get it out live"
--To build the project, the code should be written and tested, and then the code should be compiled and built into an executable file. Once the executable file is created, the project should be deployed to the appropriate environment and tested again.

(d) -- CREATE a link for the installed project
--To create a link for the installed project, the URL of the project should be shared or publicized. This can be done by publishing it on a website, sharing it on social media, or through other methods.




4. how future enhancements and bug-fixing will be handled (ie. "version Control")

-- Version control is an important part of software development, and it's important to understand how to use it. Version control is a system that keeps track of changes made to a project, allowing developers to see who made changes, when they were made, and what changes were made. 

-- There are several version control systems available, including Git, Subversion, Mercurial, and Bazaar. Each system has its own features and benefits, and developers should choose the system that is best suited for their project.

-- In the code above, version control can be used to manage changes. Whenever a change is made, it should be committed to the version control system, and the code should be tested to make sure it works. This will help to ensure that changes don't conflict with one another, and that only working code is released.

-- Version control can be used to keep track of bug fixes and feature requests. Whenever a bug is found, it should be logged in the version control system, and the code should be updated to fix the bug. Similarly, when a new feature is requested, it should be logged in the version control system, and the code should be updated to implement the feature.

-- Using version control to manage changes and bug fixes helps to ensure that changes are tracked, and that only working code is released. This helps to prevent conflicts between changes, and makes it easy to go back and see what changes were made and when they were made.



5. How to RUN the project

-- You just need to click the link and it navigates to the Index page of Registration form.
-- Then you need to provide your details (name, email and password)
-- It displays an a notigication on top of the page with your details.
